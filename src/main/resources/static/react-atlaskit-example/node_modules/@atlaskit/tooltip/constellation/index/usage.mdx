## Usage

Use tooltips to identify or add a small amount of information to an element. Typically, tooltips are used to:

- help users understand the meaning or purpose of icons
- show the full version of truncated text
- display the alternative text for an image.

Tooltips replace standard browser tooltips when more emphasis is required. Tooltips do not receive input focus.

## Best practices

- The position of tooltips is flexible and will change depending on how close the element is to the edge of the screen.
- Tooltips should only appear when the user has paused on the target element. They should remain visible if the user briefly moves the mouse off and back on to the target.
- Tooltips should not immediately disappear, unless the user hovers over another element with a tooltip.
- When the user scrolls, their attention is no longer on the tooltip. We take this opportunity to immediately hide the tooltip.
  - Mouse over, then off, a single target for a fade transition.
  - Mouse between each target for an immediate transition.
  - Mouse over, off briefly, then back over â€” there will be no transition.
  - Mouse over a target then scroll, the tooltip will be removed immediately.

Note that when using the 'mouse' position, mousing between targets will not cause an immediate transition as this would display the tooltip at the target boundary rather than a more natural position.

## Content guidelines

When writing tooltips, be short and concise and follow the ADG writing guidelines.
